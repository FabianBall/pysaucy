Introduction
------------

Pysaucy is a Python wrapper for the very efficient saucy_ algorithm for computing
the automorphism group of a graph.
Please consider saucy_'s website for information on the algorithm itself and for
requesting the source code (which is not included in pysaucy) from the authors.

The work on this package was strongly inspired by pynauty_, which analogously
provides a wrapper for the much older (when first appeared) nauty_ algorithm.
